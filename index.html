	<h2>December 9th - 2016</h2>
		<p>Winter is coming. Actually, it’s been here for quite some time now and Boulder is just starting to feel its wrath. . . This week we played, “Songs that remind us of winter and the cold”. We started out with the self titled album by the Fleet Foxes and made it all the way to bands like Minor Victories and Lo-Fang. We like to create playlists based off of our current moods or what’s relevant in our vinyl collection that week, so it’s safe to say these change often. Check out the entire playlist below and keep it around for days you feel like studying or cozying up with some warm beverages-it’s a good one! As always, we appreciate the requests from our listeners and love hearing from you! Please tell us what you think and tune in Fridays @8pm MST. Love, The people at ‘The Spins’.</p>

	<!-- 	<h2>November 11th - 2016</h2>
		<p>What came first, the title of the song, or the song itself? For this week's show we chose song titles that had people's names in them. One wonders how these songs were inspired by real people and how the artist decided to write about them.  We were able to come up with quite a few songs when searching through our vinyl collections. We ended our show with a song by Father John Misty, "Bored in the USA". This song didn't quit fit our theme of songs named after people, but we wanted to play a song that reminded us of the recent events in the USA. You know what we're talking about. This song speaks for itself and needs no explaination.</p>
		<ul>
		<li>Matilda - alt-J</li>
		<li>Ellie - Local Natives</li>
		<li>Debbie - Architecture In Helsinki</li>
		<li>Genghis Khan - Miike Snow</li>
		<li>Dr. Heckyll and Mr. Jive - Men at Work</li>
		<li>Amie - Pure Prairie League</li>
		<li>Eugene - Sufjan Stevens</li>
		<li>Oliver James - Fleet Foxes </li>
		<li>Samson - Regina Spektor</li>
		<li>Ada - The National</li>
		<li>Angela - The Lumineers</li>
		<li>Khalil Gibran - STRFKR</li>
		<li>Bored in the USA - Father John Misty</li>
